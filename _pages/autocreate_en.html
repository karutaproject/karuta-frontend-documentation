	It is possible to automate the creation of a portfolio upon the fist time a user logs into Karuta. In
	that case, Karuta will executre a batch created by the designer and the specified in the 
	<i>application/js/specific.js</i> file.

	<h3 id='condition'>Execution Condition</h3>
	<p>
		For the creation batch to execute upon the user's fist connection, the user account must have the 
		Creator	right &mdash; which should be removed at the end of the batch execution. The account must
		also have the <code>xlimited</code> instruction in the field Other.
	</p>

	<p>
		NOTE: if CAS is used, Karuta automatically creates the user account with the CAS identifier
		as username, and then sets the Creator right and <code>xlimited</code> instruction the field Other.

	<h3 id='step2'>Step 2 &mdash; Writing the Creation Batch</h3>
	<p>
		The batch must include the instructions to create one or more portfolios for the user and then
		share these portfolios with said user in the desired role. In the end it must also:
	</p>
		<ol>
			<li> remove the user's Creator right;</li>
			<li> unshare the new portfolios from the user in the <i>designer</i> role;</li>
			<li> Change the ownership of the new portfolios to root.</li>
		</ol>

	<h4>Creation of a project for the cohort</h4>
	<p>
		In our example, a project will be created for the cohort if it does not already exist (if this is 
		the first student of this cohort to log in). The project code and label are composed of the system's
		year + month (hence a new cohort every month) as specified by the global variable defined in the
		<i>specific.js</i> file.

	<h4>Instanciation of the user's portfolio</h4>

	<h4>Sharing the new portfolio with the user in the appropriate role</h4>
	<img src='../assets/img/autocreate/share-tree_en.jpg'/>

	<h4>Updating the Profile resources in the portfolio</h4>
	<p>In our portfolio model, we want to pre-fill the student's name and email.</p>
	<img src='../assets/img/autocreate/update-resources_en.jpg'/>

	<h4>Updating the user account to remove the Creator right</h4>
	<p>We use the create-person element to update an existing account.</p>

	<h4>Unsharing the portfolio from the user in the <i>designer</i> role</h4>
	<p>
		Automatic creation of the portfolio from the student account's has made the student the portfolio's
		designer, but the student must not have more that one role in the portfolio.

	<h4>Unsharing the cohort project from the user in the <i>designer</i> role</h4>

	<h4>Changing the portfolio ownership to root</h4>
	<p>
		As with the previous element: the creation of the portfolio from the student's account has made 
		him or her owner of the portfolio.
