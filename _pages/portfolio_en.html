<p>
	In Karuta portfolios are stored as structured trees. All portfolios are built following an XML
	tree structure (see the <a href='../structures_en/'>STRUCTURES</a> page for more detail).
</p>
<p>There are multiple types of Karuta trees:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Portfolio Model</li>
	<li>Portfolio Instance</li>
	<li>Rubrics Portfolio</li>
	<li>Reusable Components Portfolio</li>
	<li>Report Script</li>
	<li>Batch Script</li>
	<li>Batch Form</li>
</ul>
<h3>Portfolio Model</h3>
<p>
	A portfolio model is a tree structure that organizes resources. Resources are the elements that 
	will contain data: data supplied to the users (like instructions or files), and data supplied by 
	the users to populate their portfolios. Karuta offers resources of many types: text field, text 
	editor, file, image, audio and video player, calendar, etc (see the
	<a href='../resources_en/'>RESOURCES</a> page for more detail).
</p>
<p>
	Once built by the designer, the portfolio model is instantiated for each user, which means 
	that a copy of the model is created and the new tree is the portfolio for that specific user.
</p>
<h3>Portfolio Instance</h3>
<p>
	A portfolio instance is a copy of the model for a specific user. At the moment of instantiation 
	(copying) the roles and rights are created for each element of the portfolio, according to what 
	the designer has indicated in the metadata (see the <a href='../metadata_en/'>METADATA</a> page 
	for more detail).
</p>
<h3>Rubrics Portfolio</h3>
<p>
	A rubrics portfolio contains lists of elements that will be referenced in other portfolios, for 
	example a competency framework or the choices of a dropdown list.
</p>
<h3>Reusable Components Portfolio</h3>
<p>
	A reusable components portfolio is used to store portfolio parts that will then be made 
	available to users through a menu. This allows users to add parts to their portfolio as
	needed.
</p>
<h3>Report Script</h3>
<p>
	A report is a script that contains specific commands to select elements from one or multiple 
	portfolios and display them in a different layout. For exemple to build dashboards, resumes
	or cohort aggregate reports. The report script commands are used to navigate through portfolios 
	to select the elements to be displayed. The result is then displayed in an HTML table, the layout 
	of which is customizable by the designer (see the <b><a href='../report_en/'>Report</a></b> page
	for more detail).
</p>
<h3>Batch Script</h3>
<p>
	A batch is a script that contains specific commands to automate the process of creating user 
	accounts, creating portfolio instances, updating information in these portfolios, etc. A batch 
	script is usually associated to a CSV file containing, for example, the list of users. Executing 
	the batch script with this file will then automatically create the user accounts and the portfolios 
	(see the <b><a href='../batch_en/'>Batch</a></b> page for more detail). A batch script may also 
	be associated with a batch form.
</p>
<h3>Batch Form</h3>
<p>
	A batch form executes a batch script for one single user, without the need for a CSV file.
</p>

<h2>How It Works</h2>
<p>
	A Karuta tree or portfolio is built by adding branches to the root element, much like the 
	assembly of Lego blocks. Certain branches are predefined: the basic Karuta elements. 
	Other branches are built by the designer by combining these basic elements. In this manner 
	complex portfolios are built.
</p>
<p>
	User menus may also be defined, allowing the end user to add pre-built branches to their 
	portfolio as need be.
</p>

<h3>Model and Instance</h3>
<p>There are two types of Karuta portfolios:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		Portfolio model &ndash; Built by the designer. The associated roles are <i>designer</i> and 
		<i>all</i>.
	</li>
	<li>
		Portfolio instance &ndash; Instantiated from a portfolio model for each individual user. 
		The associated roles are those defined by the designer in the model, for example 
		<i>student</i> and <i>teacher</i>, plus <i>designer</i> and <i>all</i>.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>The diagram below illustrates the relationship between these two types of portfolios:</p>

<h3>The Security Model</h3>
<p></p>
<img src='../assets/img/modele-securite_en.png' width='50%'/>
<ul>
	<li>A portfolio has associated <b>roles</b> (example student, teacher, etc).</li>
	<li>
		A role has associated <b>rights</b> (read, edit, submit, etc) for each of the portfolio
		elements.
	</li>
	<li>Sharing a portfolio is done by indicating a user and a role.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Simulation of the Roles by the Designer</h3>
<p>
	In the portfolio model, the designer may (and should!) simulate the various roles he or she has
	created to verify the rights attributed on each element.
