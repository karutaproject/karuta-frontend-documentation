	<b>KARUTA</b> is an open source software for the construction of electronic portfolios. It is
	a flexible tool that allows the design of portfolios for multiple purposes: showcasing, support 
	to learning, support to learning assessment.
</p>
<p>
	Portfolio development may be done starting from scratch with the basic elements supplied in 
	Karuta, or from templates supplied by the Karuta community and then adapted for specific needs.
</p>

<p>The Karuta documentation is organized in three sections:</p>
<ul>
	<li><a href='../portfolio_en/'>Portfolio</a></li>
	<li><a href='../report_en/'>Report</a></li>
	<li><a href='../batch_en/'>Batch</a></li>
</ul>
<p>
	The <b><a href='../portfolio_en/'>Portfolio</a></b> section presents the structural elements 
	available to build portfolios, the resources (elements that will contain the data), the metadata 
	and the layout (CSS).
</p>
<p>
	The <b><a href='../report_en/'>Report</a></b> section presents the report script commands.
	These commands are used to navigate through portfolios, select certain elements, and display 
	them in an HTML table to build dashboards and CVs.
</p>
<p>
	The <b><a href='../batch_en/'>Batch</a></b> section presents the batch script commands.
	These commands are used to automate the creation, modification and deletion of portfolios, 
	as well as the creation and deletion of user accounts.
</p>

<h2>General Remarks</h2>
<p>
	<b>Languages</b><br>
	KARUTA is multilingual (by default English and French). The element labels are saved in the
	active working language (the active working language is selected through the flag menu at the 
	top of the Karuta pages). For end user menus and help bubbles, labels must be appended with 
	the language code and separated by a slash <code>/</code>.<br>
	Example: <i>Add a picture@en/Ajouter une photo@fr</i>
</p>
<p>
	<b>Sharing and user roles</b><br>
	Upon sharing a portfolio instance with a user, this user is paired with the portfolio in a specific 
	role (for example student or teacher). It is up to the designer to define role names. For each 
	portfolio, Karuta creates a user group for each role specified in the portfolio. Then, to share the 
	portfolio with a user, the user is placed in the corresponding user group.
</p>
<p>There are three predefined roles:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<code>designer</code> This is the user that builds portfolios. This person has all the rights
		on all the portfolio elements, regardless of the roles he or she specifies in the metadata of 
		each element.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>all</code> This keyword includes all roles defined on the portfolio. For example, by default
	 	all users have the right to see all portfolio elements, but this behavior may be modified by the 
	 	designer by removing the <code>all</code> role in the metadata.
	</li>
	<li>
		<code>user</code> This keyword will be replaced by a user's identifier at the time of 
		portfolio instanciation. This then becomes a unique role as only this specific user may have 
		this role.
	</li>
</ul>
